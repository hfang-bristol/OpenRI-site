As a result, there is a lack of dedicated resources and utilities in this area. The OpenRI resource addresses these needs by providing manual curation of gene-directed regulatory interactions across varied contexts, such as organs, tissues, and cell types. More importantly, its web-server supports data mining that encompasses the non-coding genome. 1.2 Data Resource The OpenRI resource is specially designed to be an open and scalable platform for investigating gene-directed multimodal regulatory interactions. Currently, these interactions are organised into three modalities: Activity-By-Contact (ABC) for enhancer-gene maps (see this), Promoter Capture Hi-C (PCHiC) (see this), and Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) (see this). Genes involved in regulatory interactions are annotated with a range of ontologies on functions (Gene Ontology), phenotypes (Human Phenotype Ontology), diseases (Mondo Disease Ontology), protein domains including SCOP superfamily domains (SCOP), Pfam domains (Pfam), and InterPro domains (InterPro). 1.3 Data Mining In response to the growing availability of summary-level epi/genomic datasets from cohort-scale studies, OpenRI offers web-based data-mining capabilities that cover the non-coding genome. These capabilities include: Mining - Search allows users to enter keywords to query the resource, which returns context-specific pages and gene-specific pages related to the query. Mining - Browse allows users to navigate through different contexts such as organs, tissues, and cell types to interactively explore their regulatory interactions. Mining - RI2Genes allows users to mine the resource to identify potential regulatory genes from their input data (see Example Output). Mining - RI2Terms allows users to mine the resource to identify potential regulatory genes and enriched ontology terms from their input data (see Example Output).

"],["mining---search.html", "Section 3 Mining - Search", " Section 3 Mining - Search The faceted search serves as a centralised mining hub within the OpenRI resource. It provides hyperlinks within the search results, supporting full-text queries for both contexts and genes. When searching for contexts, the search results are hyperlinked to context-specific pages; these pages provide the context information along with a tabular display for regulatory interactions between genomic regions and genes. Similarly, when searching for a particular gene, the search results provide hyperlinks to gene-specific pages; these pages contain comprehensive gene information, including its regulatory interactions (displayed separately for different modalities), and where applicable, annotated terms (of various ontologies).
