The OpenRI resource addresses these needs, including manual curation of gene-directed regulatory interactions across a wide range of contexts (eg organs, tissues, and cell types), and supporting their use for data mining inclusive of non-coding genome. 1.2 Contents The OpenRI resource is designed to be open and scalable for gene-directed multimodal regulatory interactions. These interactions are currently organised into three modals: Activity-By-Contact (ABC) for enhancer-gene maps, Promoter Capture Hi-C (PCHiC), and Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL). 1.3 Mining In parallel with the growth in summary-level epi/genomic datasets generated from cohort-scale studies, OpenRI provides the users with web-based data-mining opportunities inclusive of non-coding genome, including: Mining - Search, an entry point to mine the resource with the keyword in query returning context-specific pages and gene-specific pages; Mining - Browse, navigating contexts (eg organs, tissues, and cell types) to enable interactive exploration of their regulatory interactions; Mining - RI2Genes, mining the resource to identify potential regulatory genes (see Example Output) from user-input data; Mining - RI2Terms, mining the resource to identify potential regulatory genes and enriched ontology terms (see Example Output) from user-input data.

Full text query is supported for contexts and genes. Search results for contexts are hyperlinked to context-specific pages, displaying the context information as well as the tabular display for regulatory interactions between genomic regions and genes. Search results for a particular gene are hyperlinked to the gene-specific page, displaying the gene information, its regulatory interactions (displayed separately for different modals), and where available, its annotated terms (of different ontologies).

The integers in the red hexagons denote sequential clicks. Top: the browse page lists contexts for regulatory interactions with different modals, including the modal Activity-By-Contact (ABC). Bottom-left: the context-specific page for the context C0001: A549_Roadmap (PMID33828297), which lists its regulatory interactions between genomic regions and genes (each gene hyperlinked to the gene-specific page). Bottom-right: the gene-specific page for the gene ROCK1P1, which lists its regulatory interactions separately for different modals (this is, ABC, PCHiC and QTL), with each context hyperlinked to the context-specific page.
